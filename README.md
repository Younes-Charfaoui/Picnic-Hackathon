## Why the challenge?
One of our core beliefs is to offer our customers the best support possible, by allowing them, for example, to send in pictures of defect products they wish to be reimbursed for. But processing these pictures is very time-consuming as it is all done manually.

## What is the challenge?
The challenge we propose is the following: As a first step in helping customer support, come up with a way of labeling every picture that comes in according to the product that is in the picture. To keep with the Picnic spirit, we encourage to be as innovative and creative with your solutions as possible.

# Dataset
To that end, we offer the following [dataset](https://github.com/Younes-Charfaoui/Picnic-Hackathon/blob/master/images/picnic_logo.png) of pictures of defect items.
